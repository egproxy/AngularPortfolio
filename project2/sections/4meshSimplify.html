<h2>3.4 Quadratic Simplification</h2>
<div class="section-wrapper">

	<p>To implement Garland's 97 paper on quadric mesh simplification, the order to perform the edge collapses is done by a priority queue data structure was used. The following algorithm was used to push the data on to the heap which was given in the slides:</p>

	<p>First, the CalcInitialQ() method, which calculates all vertices Quadric matrix by looping through all vertices stored in the mesh, in which is used to compute Q for all vertices vi. The following plane equation ax + by + cz + d = 0 where a , b, c are values of the normal of the plane, and d = v-normalwhere v is the position on the plane in my case, pos->face->halfedge[0].vertex->position where pos is an iterator of the vertex list in mesh. Then, getting the quadric matrix of the initial vertices by summing up all adjacent faces. This is done by callng the SumQ method is called where it stores an array of 10 floating point numbers per vertex for storage efficiency, in which uses the model:</p>

	<p>Due to not using the threshold to find all valid pairs, then the best pair each vertex belongs to will be used. However, since a half edge data structure has been implemented, in which includes an edge list in the mesh, that edge list contains all valid pairs, in which contains the best pairs.</p>

	<p>Next is computing the optimal position by using the method CalcOptimalPos(Edge *) for each edge which contains the valid pairs. Using each vertexâ€™s floating point array [10], a 4x4 Quadric matrix is calculated and stored. Then a gaussian elimination is performed with the equation SolveLinearEquation(double(*matrix)[4], Vector4 rhs, Vector4 &amp;solution), in which finds out if it is singular. If the solution is not unique. Then the end points will be used to be stored in the optimal position, in which is determined if it is a boundary edge or not. If it is a boundary edge then, v0 will be used, and if it is not a boundary edge v1 will be used as the optimal position. If the solution is unique, then the optimal position will be the solution, in which is stored in the edge. Then edge will be pushed onto the heap, in which will give the least error based on the cost in the priority queue</p>
