<h2>3.1 Mesh Viewer</h2>
<div class="section-wrapper">
	<p>The viewer can perform basic operations such as rotate, translate, 
	and scale with the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>‘z’ = Scale up</li>
		<li>‘Z’ = Scale down</li>
		<li>‘w’ = translate up</li>
		<li>‘s’ = translate down</li>
		<li>‘a’ = translate left</li>
		<li>‘d’ = translate right</li>
		<li>‘right click + drag’ =  rotate model</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Scaling is implemented with the method glScalef(scale, scale, scale), in 
	which the float scale increase or decrease every time you scale up or down.
	Translate is down by moving the eye of the camera, and the camera is
	implemented with:</p>
	<pre>glOrtho(-1.1, 1.1, -1.1, 1.1, -10000, 10000)</pre> 
	
	<p>The models are read in with the function:</p> 
	<pre>bool ReadOFFFile(char *filename)</pre>
	
	<p>I implemented a nicer shading on the mesh by computing normals with 
	surface area weights. The reason I use surface area weights is because
	if computed normals regularly, it will cause two problems.<p>
	<dl>
		<dt>Problem #1</dt>
 		<dd>triangles may make up the thin edges of a box will ‘claim’ much of 
 		the normal orientation. This causes ‘rounded’ shading on the large flat
 		sides of the box.</dd>
 		<dt>Problem #2</dt>
		<dd>This is then made worse because two corners of those large sides
		contribute two times the facet normal (two triangles touch the vertex), 
		while the other two corners contribute only one times (one triangle 
		touches the vertex). This results into a discontinuity (a diagonal 
		artifact) when shaded.</dd>
	</dl>

	<p>The surface area weights calculation will solve these problems and is done 
	in the CalcFaceNormal(Face * fi), where i take two vertex, and cross product 
	it, which gives me the normal. Before normalizing the normal, I find the 
	area of the triangle which is 0.5f * normal.length(). Finally, I normalize 
	the normal. However, this only calculates face normals for every triangle. 
	In order to calculate vertex normals for nice shading, I first create a 
	vector which stores all the faces for every vertex. Then, I use this vector 
	to calculate my vertex normal, which is done by for each vertex, I multiply 
	the face normal stored in the vertex with the area of the face for each face 
	each vertex has. A vertex can have a maximum of two faces. After summing up 
	the faces to calculate the normal for each vertex, it is then divided by the 
	cumulative area in, where it is then normalized. This will give us a smooth 
	shading.</p>

	<p>In order to automatically compute a default scale for display, so the 
	mesh is centered on the screen, I recalc all the vertices by translating 
	to the center (0,0,0). This is done by finding the maximum and minimum 
	x,y,z positions, then calculating the center with the following:</p>
	<pre>Vector3 center = max - (max - min) / 2.0f;
	where max and min are Vector3 which stores the max and min of x,y,z.</pre>

	<p>The scale factor is computed by 2.0f/max. Then, each vertex is translated 
	to (0,0,0) by subtracting the calculated center and then multiplying the 
	cale factor. This centers every model, and also scaled to a pleasing size.</p>

	<p>All data read from the off file are stored in a Mesh class which contains 
	list&lt;Vertex&gt; vertices, list&lt;Face&gt; faces, list&lt;edge&gt; edges.
	This is so I can achieve constant time time complexity for adding and 
	removing.</p>

	<p>The following are four different constructed constructed models; cow, 
	brain, armadillo, and bunny:</p>
