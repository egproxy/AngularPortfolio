<h2>3.2 Mesh Connectivity Data Structure</h2>
<div class="section-wrapper">
	

	<p>I implemented a half-edge data structure because it lets you walk around
	face very easily which will make other operations for edge collapse done 
	easier as well as vertex split. Even though it takes more time to implement,
	and is more complex I believe it would help me in the long run. It also has 
	compact storage. My data structure  can efficiently update for edge collapse 
	since I am able to find all the faces adjacent to any vertex, and update the 
	adjacency information easily as each half edge contains all the information 
	needed.</p> 


	<p>To construct a half edge data structure, the following four classes had
	to be implemented:</p> 
	
	<dl>
		
		<dt>Vertex</dt>

		<dd>Vertex contains a position, normal, a connecting  halfedge, 
		isBoundary, to find if it is a boundary. and an index which is the 
		order stored when reading in from the off file. The same index 
		concept applies to edges, and faces, where it is very useful when 
		constructing the faces for surrounding each vertex, as well as 
		finding boundary information.</dd>

		<dt>HalfEdge</dt>

		<dd>HalfEdge contains a pointer to the next and previous half edge 
		which creates the face, inverse half-edge, which is the inverse half 
		edge where an inverse halfedge and itself constructs an edge, a vertex 
		where the halfedge originates from, and the face the halfedge belongs 
		to. It also contains an edge, where an edge stores two half edges, 
		the current half-edge and inverse of that halfedge.</dd>
		
		<dt>Edge</dt>
		
		<dd>An edge class contains an index, and two halfedges: halfedge[0] and 
		halfedge[1]. If the edge is a boundary edge, then halfedge[1] would be
		set to nullptr, since halfedge[1] is the inverse of halfedge[0].</dd>
		
		<dt>Face</dt>

		<dd>Face contains three halfedges, which belongs to the same face, and
		is connected like a circular list, a normal, its surface area, and an
		index as well.</dd>

	</dl>


	<p>When reading in the off file, I have constructed all the vertices, and 
	faces positions and index in which is stored in a list in mesh. After
	reading the off file, I then create the half edge data structure with the
	method BuildConnect().</p>


	<p>First, for each face f, the next and previous of f’s halfedge are set, so
	that it can create a circular list. Then f.halfedge[i].face = f where i is
	0,1,2, and f.hafledge[i].vertex->connectingHe is set to f.halfedge[i].</p>


	<p>The inverse of each halfedge is constructed in the following way:</p>

	<p>A ring array is created which stores faces adjacent to each vertex, where 
	ring[i], i is the index of a vertex. The construction is done by looping 
	through each face and pushing back the face to the vertices associated with 
	it. Then to find the inverse half edge, the other face stored in the ring 
	will contain it. To find the inverse vertex, loop through the other face’s 
	halfedge and find the two end points matching the current half edges end 
	points. Then set the inverse each half edge, and edge. If there is no 
	econd face, then the current edge is a boundary edge, and the inverse 
	halfedge is set to nullptr. Then for each face, an edge is constructed, 
	which contains halfedge, and inverse halfedge and push it into the edge 
	list in the mesh class, where there will be three edges per face. This 
	creates the edge information.</p>
